# Determinism & replay

box3d steps deterministically and can **record** a simulation, **validate** that it reproduces
bit-identical state, and **replay** it frame by frame. This is the tooling for lockstep / rollback
netcode, authoritative server physics, and reproducing "it only happens sometimes" bugs — and no
other Unity physics wrapper ships it.

## What a recording captures

A recording is the **physics** of a run: collision shapes, body transforms, contacts, and a
per-step state hash. It is *not* your Unity scene — no meshes, materials, or prefabs. So a replay
draws the world as debug **wireframes** (through the same draw bridge as [debug draw](debug-draw.md)),
not your rendered objects. That's expected: this is a physics-state viewer, not cinematic playback.

Recordings are **snapshot-seeded** — the full world state is captured at `StartRecording`, so the
replay stands up the same bodies even if you start recording after the world is populated.

## Determinism check (record → validate)

The headline: prove your simulation is reproducible.

- **`Box3DRecorder`** — drop it on a GameObject in a scene with a `Box3DWorld`. It records from the
  start, and after **Record Steps** stops and runs box3d's replay validation, logging
  **`DETERMINISTIC`** or **`DIVERGED`**. A `DIVERGED` result means something in your scene is
  non-deterministic (unseeded randomness, frame-rate-dependent forces) — box3d's own stepping is not.
  - **Cross-thread test:** set the `Box3DWorld`'s **Worker Count** to 4 and the recorder's **Validate
    Worker Count** to 1 (or vice-versa). Still `DETERMINISTIC` means box3d reproduces identically
    regardless of thread count — the guarantee networked games need.
  - Context menu (⋮): **Stop & Validate**, **Validate Determinism**, **Save Recording**.

## Replay & scrub (record → replay)

- **`Box3DReplayer`** — plays back a `.rec` file (or live capture bytes) in its own replay world,
  debug-drawn. In Play mode the component's Inspector shows a **Timeline**: a frame slider,
  transport buttons (◀ / play-pause / step / restart), and a live **`DIVERGED at frame N`** read-out.
  It needs no `Box3DWorld` or bodies in the scene — it stands up its own world from the recording.

Wireframes render in the **Scene view** always, and in the **Game view only with Gizmos** enabled
(same caveat as debug draw).

### Visual replay (real objects)

- **`Box3DVisualReplayer`** — plays the recording back on the scene's **actual GameObjects** (meshes,
  materials, everything) instead of wireframes. It pauses live physics and drives each recorded body
  onto its scene object, so you watch the recorded run with full visuals and the same scrub timeline.

  Use it in the **same scene the recording was made in**. Mapping is by **body name**: `Box3DBody`
  names its body after the GameObject, so give bodies **unique names** for exact playback (same-named
  bodies are paired best-effort). Bodies with no scene object (e.g. the joint world anchor) are simply
  skipped. It logs how many replay bodies it mapped.

  Pick `Box3DReplayer` (wireframe) when you don't have the original scene; pick `Box3DVisualReplayer`
  when you do and want it to look real.

## Doing it from code (raw API)

The components wrap a small low-level API you can drive directly — useful for raw-API worlds or
headless validation:

```csharp
World world = World.Create(worldDef);
// ... create bodies ...

var recording = Recording.Create();       // sized buffer; grows up to its cap
world.StartRecording(recording);          // snapshot-seeded from here

for (int i = 0; i < 300; i++) world.Step(1f / 60f, 4);

world.StopRecording();
bool deterministic = recording.ValidateReplay(workerCount: 1);   // the determinism check
recording.SaveToFile("run.rec");

// Later — replay it:
ReplayPlayer player = ReplayPlayer.Create(recording.GetData(), workerCount: 1);
player.EnableShapeDrawing();               // wire the draw bridge so shapes draw (main thread)
player.SeekFrame(120);                     // jump anywhere
player.World.DrawDebug(DebugDrawFlags.Shapes | DebugDrawFlags.Contacts);
if (player.HasDiverged) Debug.Log($"diverged at frame {player.DivergeFrame}");

player.Destroy();                          // both own native memory
recording.Destroy();
```

`ReplayPlayer` exposes `StepFrame` / `SeekFrame` / `Restart`, `Frame` / `FrameCount` / `IsAtEnd`,
`HasDiverged` / `DivergeFrame`, `GetInfo()` (frame count, timestep, sub-steps, worker count, bounds),
`SetWorkerCount`, per-body access (`BodyCount` / `GetBody(i)`), and the replayed `World`.

## When to reach for it

- **Networked physics** — verify lockstep/rollback determinism, including across worker counts.
- **Bug repro** — capture a run that misbehaves and scrub to the exact frame it goes wrong.
- **Regression tests** — `ValidateReplay` in a test asserts a scene stays deterministic.
