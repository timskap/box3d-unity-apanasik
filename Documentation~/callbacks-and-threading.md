# Callbacks & threading

## Multithreading

Box3D runs its own internal job scheduler. Opt in per world:

```csharp
WorldDef def = WorldDef.Default;
def.WorkerCount = (uint)Mathf.Max(1, SystemInfo.processorCount / 2); // ≈ physical cores
World world = World.Create(def);
```

Guidance from box3d itself: use performance cores only — hyper-threads add little. Scaling depends
on how many independent **islands** your scene has (see [Performance](performance.md)): thousands
of loose objects scale beautifully; one giant jointed structure barely parallelizes.

`Step` blocks until the step completes — from your code's perspective the API is single-threaded
and there is nothing to synchronize... *except* the callbacks below.

## Callbacks

Most games never need these — the polled [events](events.md) cover reactions, and filters cover
most collision rules. Callbacks exist for the cases polling can't do: vetoing contacts and custom
material mixing. **They are invoked from worker threads during `Step`** when `WorkerCount > 1`,
so they must be pure functions: no Unity API, no world mutation, no allocation, no locks.

```csharp
// Decide collision for shape pairs that BOTH set ShapeDef.EnableCustomFiltering:
world.SetCustomFilterCallback((shapeA, shapeB) => TeamOf(shapeA) != TeamOf(shapeB));

// Veto individual contacts per step (shape needs ShapeDef.EnablePreSolveEvents).
// Classic use: one-way platforms.
world.SetPreSolveCallback((shapeA, shapeB, point, normal) => normal.y > 0.5f);

// Custom material mixing (defaults: friction = sqrt(a·b), restitution = max(a, b)).
world.SetFrictionCallback((fa, matA, fb, matB) => math.min(fa, fb));
```

Pass `null` to any setter to restore default behavior. Exceptions thrown inside a callback are
caught, logged, and replaced by the engine default (an exception escaping into a native worker
thread would crash the player).

One limitation inherited from the native API: the friction/restitution mixers receive no world
context, so the wrapper keeps a single **global** managed mixer of each kind — the last
registration wins across all worlds. Filter and pre-solve callbacks are properly per-world.

## Logging and asserts

Box3D's internal log and assert output is routed to the Unity console automatically at startup
(`Box3DRuntime.Install`, run via `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod`). Assertion failures from API
misuse (bad defs, stale ids in debug paths) appear as errors with the native file/line.
